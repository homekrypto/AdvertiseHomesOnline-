Step 1 — Create a Real Test User

Go to the registration page → create a new account with your actual name.

Confirm email and log in.

Optional: Set up 2FA to test full security flow.

Verify that the dashboard greeting now shows your real name, not “Demo.”

✅ Outcome: No more “Welcome back, Demo!” placeholder.

Step 2 — Populate Properties Table

Log in as Agent/Agency (must have a plan that allows property creation).

Navigate to “Add Property” in dashboard.

Fill in all required fields:

Title / Address / City / ZIP

Price / Bedrooms / Bathrooms / Area

Upload real media (images, videos) → S3 + CloudFront integration.

Submit → check database (PostgreSQL/DynamoDB) → property should now exist.

✅ Outcome: Dashboard shows actual property; frontend pulls live data from database, no placeholders.

Step 3 — Test Feature Flags & Plan Limits

Verify that the property count respects your subscription tier (e.g., Agent: max 5 properties).

Test additional plan features:

Featured listing placement (consume credits)

Bulk CSV import (Agency plan)

AI pricing suggestions (Expert plan)

✅ Outcome: All plan restrictions and premium features work with live data.

Step 4 — Verify End-to-End Integration

Log out → log in as different user roles (Free, Premium, Agent, Agency, Expert).

Ensure dashboards, API endpoints, and property listings fetch live data correctly.

Check:

CRUD for properties

Saved searches / favorites

Alerts / notifications

Real-time analytics & leads

✅ Outcome: Confirms frontend ↔ backend ↔ database integration works fully.

Step 5 — Test Stripe & Payments

Subscribe a user to a paid plan (Stripe test mode).

Verify subscription creation API, webhooks, and real-time feature flag updates.

Ensure plan upgrade/downgrade reflects correctly in dashboard and backend.

✅ Outcome: Payment & subscription logic fully live.

Step 6 — Populate Admin & Analytics Data

Log in as Super Admin → check all user accounts and properties.

Test analytics dashboards (revenue, leads, property performance).

Add dummy metrics if needed to visualize functionality — this is real backend data, not mock/frontend placeholders.

✅ Outcome: Admin dashboards functional with live data.

Step 7 — Continuous End-to-End Testing

Repeat login → add property → verify database → dashboard → frontend API call → leads/notifications.

Each task in the TODO plan should be verified live, no mock data, all connections active.

Once these steps are complete:

The platform will feel real, not like a demo.

You can continue the TODO plan without stress, ensuring every function is fully integrated end-to-end.
