Integration Mapping Template — Must Be Completed

Instructions:

Fill all fields accurately with URLs, endpoints, tables, and service names.

Use this to show real connections: frontend ↔ backend ↔ database ↔ external services (Stripe, SES/SNS, storage).

Include data flow and role handling for each route/feature.

1️⃣ Frontend → Backend
Feature / Page	API Endpoint	HTTP Method	Data Sent	Data Received	Role / Plan Restrictions	Notes
Login	/api/auth/login	POST	email/password	JWT + user info	All	Must redirect to correct dashboard

Add Property	/api/properties/add	POST	Property details + media URL	Property ID + status	Agent/Agency/Expert	Validate quota limits per plan
Browse Properties	/api/properties	GET	Filters, search	Property list	All	Should display real-time data

✅ Developer Deliverables:

Complete all tables above with accurate, live connections.

Fix “Get Started” and login redirects to go to internal dashboards.

Ensure all features fetch/store live data in database — no dummy data.

Include screenshots or short videos proving login → dashboard → add property works per plan.

Mark any missing or incomplete tasks from the original TODO list with explanations and ETA.
