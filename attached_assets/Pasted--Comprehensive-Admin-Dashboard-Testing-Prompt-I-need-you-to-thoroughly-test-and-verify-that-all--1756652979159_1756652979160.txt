   - API endpoints with documentation
   - Database schema relevant to the feature
   - Any configuration files or settings

2. **Testing Instructions:**
   - Step-by-step instructions on how I can test each feature

## Issue Resolution Process

If any issues are found during testing:
1. Clearly document the issue
2. Provide a timeline for resolution
3. Implement the fix
4. Provide proof of implementation
5. Supply new testing instructions to verify the fix

Please confirm that all components are using real production data and not mock or hardcoded data. If any component is not production-ready, please clearly identify it and provide a plan for implementation.

Final delivery should include a comprehensive report detailing the status of each feature, evidence of implementation, and clear testing instructions for my verification.
