Provide a detailed description of the current implementation of the tier/pricing/role system in the production platform. Focus exclusively on how the system works RIGHT NOW - no suggestions for improvements, no future plans, only existing functionality.

REQUIRED DESCRIPTION SECTIONS
1. CURRENT TIER STRUCTURE
List all existing subscription tiers with exact names as they appear in the system
Describe how tiers are represented in the database (table names, field names)
Explain the relationship between user roles and subscription tiers
Detail how a user's tier is determined and stored
2. PRICING IMPLEMENTATION
Document the exact pricing amounts for each tier as currently implemented
Describe how pricing is stored (database tables, hardcoded values, etc.)
Explain the billing cycle structure (monthly, annual, etc.)
Detail how prices are displayed to users during registration/upgrade
3. PERMISSION SYSTEM
List all permissions currently associated with each tier
Explain how permissions are enforced in the system
Describe how the system determines what features a user can access
Detail any role-based restrictions in the UI or API endpoints
4. FEATURE LIMITATIONS
Document all current usage limits per tier (properties, leads, etc.)
Explain how these limits are enforced in the system
Describe what happens when users reach their limits
Detail any tier-specific features or capabilities
5. SUBSCRIPTION LIFECYCLE
Describe the complete subscription flow from registration to cancellation
Explain how subscription status changes are handled
Detail how upgrades/downgrades currently work
Document any automated processes related to subscriptions
6. DASHBOARD DIFFERENTIATION
Describe how the dashboard experience differs between tiers

Detail how tier information is accessed across frontend/backend
8. CURRENT LIMITATIONS
List all known limitations or gaps in the current implementation
Describe any hardcoded elements that should be database-driven
Document any missing functionality related to tiers
Explain any workarounds currently in use
DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
Format: Plain English description - no code snippets
Scope: Only describe what currently exists - no suggestions
Detail: Include all relevant aspects of the tier system
Accuracy: Describe the actual implementation, not intended behavior
Completeness: Cover all points in the sections above
SUBMISSION
Respond with a comprehensive description that fully documents the current state of the tier system as implemented in the production platform. Focus on providing complete information about how the system works today.
