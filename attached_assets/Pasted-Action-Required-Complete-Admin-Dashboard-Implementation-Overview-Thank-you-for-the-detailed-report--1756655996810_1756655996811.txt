Action Required: Complete Admin Dashboard Implementation
Overview
Thank you for the detailed report. I acknowledge that the admin dashboard is 85% complete with solid foundations in place. However, I need you to address the critical issues and complete the remaining work to make the entire system production-ready.

Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention
1. TypeScript Errors in Subscription Management
Current Issue: Type safety errors in AdminSubscriptionManagement.tsx where properties like activeSubscriptions, monthlyRevenue, and churnRate don't exist on type {}.

Required Action:

Implement the SubscriptionStats interface as suggested in your report
Update all components that use subscription data to ensure type safety
Verify that all subscription-related API responses properly implement this interface
Deliverables:

Code showing the implemented SubscriptionStats interface
Updated AdminSubscriptionManagement.tsx with proper typing
Evidence that all TypeScript errors are resolved
2. API Authentication Issues
Current Issue: No way to test API endpoints without proper authentication, as demonstrated by the unauthorized curl response.

Required Action:

Implement a proper admin authentication system for API access
Provide a testing endpoint or method to authenticate admin sessions
Ensure all admin API endpoints are properly protected
Deliverables:

Documentation on how to authenticate for API testing
Code showing proper implementation of admin authentication for APIs
Example curl commands that successfully access admin endpoints after authentication
3. Stripe Integration Gaps
Current Issue: Critical subscription management features (cancellation, refunds) are using stub implementations instead of real Stripe API calls.

Required Action:

Implement real Stripe API integration for subscription cancellation
Implement real Stripe API integration for refund processing
Add proper error handling for Stripe API failures
Implement webhook handlers for Stripe events
Deliverables:

Code showing real Stripe API integration (not stubs)
Documentation of the Stripe integration implementation
Test cases demonstrating successful subscription cancellation and refunds
Implementation Priorities
Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Due in 1-2 days)
Fix all TypeScript errors in subscription management
Implement proper API authentication for testing
Add missing interface definitions
Phase 2: Complete Stripe Integration (Due in 3-5 days)
Real subscription cancellation via Stripe API
Payment refund processing with Stripe
Webhook handlers for Stripe events
Error handling for payment failures
Phase 3: Enhanced Analytics (Due in 2-3 days)
Complete geographic data implementation
Real cohort analysis functionality
Data export capabilities
Testing Requirements
For each fix, provide:

Implementation Proof:
Code snippets showing the implementation
API endpoints with updated documentation
Database changes if applicable
Testing Instructions:
Step-by-step instructions to verify each fix
Sample test data and expected outcomes
Methods to verify production-readiness (not using mock data)
Evidence of Completion:
Screenshots or logs showing successful tests
Performance metrics where applicable
Security considerations addressed
Final Deliverables
Upon completion of all phases, provide:

A comprehensive report detailing the status of each feature
Evidence that all critical issues have been resolved
Updated testing guide for the entire admin dashboard
Confirmation that all components are using real production data
