Continue & Complete All ToDo Plan Tasks

Work continuously through all phases without stopping until every task is implemented, tested, and verified.

Pending tasks include but are not limited to:

Media Upload Component (Phase 3.2) → ensure all images/videos are stored in cloud object storage and accessible via CDN.

Real-time Subscription Updates (Phase 4.3) → webhook handling, automatic role updates, frontend reflects changes live.

Lead Management & Notifications (Phase 5.1) → smart routing, SES/SNS notifications, automated lead assignment.

Frontend Permission Guards (Phase 2.3) → fully enforce role-based access, component-level permissions.

API Rate Limiting & Security Enhancements (Phase 7.1) → endpoint protection, throttling, input validation.

All other remaining phases (AI/Automation, SEO, Reporting, Analytics, Performance Optimization) → fully implemented and tested.

Ensure Complete End-to-End Integration

Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database (DynamoDB) → all dashboards, forms, features must fetch and store live data, no mock/dummy data.

Ensure all CRUD operations, media handling, analytics, and subscriptions work seamlessly together.

Test role-based access, feature flags, and subscription limits across all user tiers.

Verify all APIs, endpoints, and integrations (Stripe, SES/SNS, S3/CloudFront) function correctly in cloud environment.

No local services – disable port 5000 or any other local processes; everything must run on cloud infrastructure.

Full Feature Verification & Testing

After implementing each feature, perform comprehensive testing:

User registration, login, SSO, 2FA

Dashboard data display per role/plan

Property CRUD with media upload and analytics

Subscription plan enforcement & payments

Lead routing and notification system

AI/Automation features (if Expert tier)

Ensure all features interact correctly across front-end, back-end, and database with live data.

Reporting & Progress Tracking

Provide continuous updated status reports showing:

Tasks completed

Tasks in progress

Tasks pending

Any blockers or issues

Include verification of live data interactions and screenshots or logs demonstrating integration correctness.

✅ Goal: Full, end-to-end integrated platform, all features fully functional, tested, and live with DynamoDB-backed data, ready for final QA and optimization.
