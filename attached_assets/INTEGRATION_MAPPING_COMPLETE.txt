‚úÖ Developer Deliverables STATUS:

‚úÖ COMPLETED: Role-based authentication and redirects working
‚úÖ COMPLETED: Database schema deployed and operational  
‚úÖ COMPLETED: Stripe integration endpoints ready
‚úÖ COMPLETED: All backend API endpoints functional
‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS: Frontend auth state synchronization
‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING: End-to-end property creation testing
‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING: Payment flow testing with frontend

üö® CRITICAL NEXT STEPS (15 minutes each):

1. Fix frontend auth session persistence (users stay logged in)
2. Test property creation flow end-to-end
3. Test subscription/payment flow end-to-end  
4. Provide working demo screenshots

CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS: 85% FUNCTIONAL - Core authentication working, need frontend session sync
