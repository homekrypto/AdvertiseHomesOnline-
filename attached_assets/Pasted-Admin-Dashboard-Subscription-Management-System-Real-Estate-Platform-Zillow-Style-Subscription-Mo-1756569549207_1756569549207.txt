Expert Plan Automation Flow
1. New Listing Creation
    * An agent adds a new property listing in the platform.
2. Auto-Blog Generation
    * The system (via API + n8n automation) instantly creates a blog article from the listing details (photos, description, price, location, etc.).
    * Blog is SEO-friendly and published under the agent’s or agency’s profile.
3. Social Media Distribution
    * The blog content is automatically transformed into posts (shortened text + image + link) and pushed to connected social media accounts:
        * Facebook Page
        * Instagram (feed or story)
        * LinkedIn (company/agent profile)
        * Twitter/X
        * (optionally TikTok/YouTube via snippets if media is available)
4. Time-Saving Cycle
    * Instead of manually posting on 4–5 platforms, the agent just publishes a listing once.
    * Automation takes care of content formatting, scheduling, and posting across all channels.
5. Extra Features
    * Scheduling: agent can choose immediate publishing or scheduled times.
    * Customization: pre-set templates (branding colors, hashtags, call-to-action).
    * Tracking: dashboard shows reach, clicks, and engagement metrics.

👉 In short: One action (create a property listing) triggers a full marketing cycle: blog article + multi-channel social media distribution — saving hours per week for busy agents.

  suspended: 'Admin action/abuse'
}

🔐 1. Registration (Join / Sign-Up)
* Email + Password flow (secure password policy: min length, special char, hash with bcrypt/argon2).
* Social login (Google at minimum; later Apple, LinkedIn, Facebook optional).
* Two-step registration:
    * Step 1 → Collect name, email, password (or OAuth).
    * Step 2 → Collect role/type (Agent, Agency, Expert) + billing info.
* Email verification (magic link or token, expires in 15 min).
* CAPTCHA / bot protection (Google reCAPTCHA v3 / hCaptcha).
* Consent capture → accept ToS, Privacy Policy, marketing opt-in checkbox.
* Plan selection (monthly/yearly) + checkout → direct to Stripe (or other PSP).
* Discount codes / promotions (handled by Stripe Coupons or internal logic).
* Trial period (e.g. 14 days free before first charge).

🔑 2. Login
* Email + password login.
* Social login (Google, Apple, etc.).
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) → TOTP (Google Authenticator/Authy) or SMS/email code.
* Session management → JWT or OAuth2 tokens; refresh + access tokens with rotation.
* Device management (user can see active devices & log out remotely).

🛠 3. Account Recovery
* Forgot password flow → email reset link (time-bound, single use).
* Username/email recovery (send reminder if user forgets).
* Magic link login (optional modern recovery flow).
* Recovery codes (if MFA enabled, download 5 one-time codes).

💳 4. Subscription & Payments
* Stripe (or other PSP) integration with:
    * Monthly & yearly billing options.
    * Automatic prorations (upgrade/downgrade mid-cycle).
    * Free trials.
    * Discounts (e.g., yearly = 2 months free, coupon codes).

* Webhook handling → listen to invoice.paid, customer.subscription.updated, invoice.payment_failed.
* Automatic account suspension if payment fails (after grace period).
* Invoice history & downloadable receipts inside dashboard.
* Team billing (Agency can add multiple sub-users under one subscription).

📂 5. Database Schema (Core Tables)
* Users → id, name, email, password_hash, oauth_id, verified, role.
* Sessions/Tokens → jwt_id, refresh_token, expiry, user_id.
* Subscriptions → user_id, plan_id, stripe_subscription_id, status, start_date, end_date.
* Plans → id, name, limits (listings, AI tools, etc.), price_monthly, price_yearly.
* Payments → invoice_id, stripe_payment_id, amount, currency, status.
* Logs/Audit → login history, IP, device.

🖥 6. Frontend (User-Facing UX)
* Clean signup/login UI (2025 standards → minimal, mobile-first, accessibility WCAG 2.2).
* Dashboard:
    * Subscription status & upgrade/downgrade.
    * Invoice history.
    * Active sessions/devices.
    * Security settings (change email, password, MFA).

🛡 7. Security Best Practices (2025)

* WebAuthn / Passkeys support → biometric login on mobile/desktop.
* Encrypted at rest (AES-256) + in transit (TLS 1.3).
* Audit logging for all auth & billing actions.
* Zero trust: role-based access control (RBAC) everywhere.
* 
* 🏗 Professional 2025 SaaS Stack (Complete)
* 1️⃣ User Identity & Access
* Secure register/login/recover (email + password, Google OAuth, MFA, passkeys/WebAuthn).
* Account roles: Browser, Registered, Premium, Agent, Agency, Expert.
* Full RBAC (role-based access control) tied to subscription tier.
* Account recovery: password reset, magic links, recovery codes for MFA.
* Device/session management with remote logouts.
* ✅ This ensures trust and frictionless onboarding.
* 
* 2️⃣ Subscription & Payment System
* Stripe integration → monthly/yearly + coupons/discounts.
* Trial support (e.g., 7–14 days).
* Auto-downgrade/suspension if failed payments.
* Plan entitlements (Agent=5 listings, Agency=25, Expert=unlimited + AI).
* Team billing for Agencies.
* Invoices, refunds, and tax-handling (Stripe Tax / VAT rules).
* ✅ Direct tie-in with database → subscription controls access everywhere.
* 
* 3️⃣ Database & Backend Integration
* Single source of truth:
    * users (auth, identity, OAuth ID).
    * subscriptions (plan, status, billing cycle).
    * properties (listing data, SEO fields, ownership).
    * seo_metadata (auto-generated titles, descriptions, structured data).
* Webhooks from Stripe update subscription + user status in real-time.
* Audit logging of all user + admin actions.
* ✅ No separation: SEO, auth, payments → all linked in the same DB + backend.
* 
* 4️⃣ Advanced SEO System (your doc 🚀✅)
* Ultra-clean URLs (slug = title + city + country).
* Meta titles + H1 + meta descriptions → all auto-generated from DB.
* JSON-LD structured data (RealEstateListing schema).
* Breadcrumbs + internal linking → pulls directly from database hierarchy.
* Dynamic XML sitemaps auto-updating with properties.
* Canonical URL enforcement + redirects.
* Open Graph + Twitter Cards → share-ready previews.
* Responsive image optimization (WebP/AVIF + alt text).
* ✅ Already world-class. Now: directly connected to subscription & database.
* 
* 5️⃣ Joining Auth + Subscription + SEO
* This is the critical glue 👇
* SEO metadata pulls from property DB → only active paid agents/agencies can push new listings into sitemap + schema.
* Public pages (listings, searches) → indexed & optimized.
* Private features (analytics, contact details, AI tools) → behind subscription login.
* Stripe subscription events → auto-hide properties from sitemap if plan expires.
* SEO automation → every new property automatically gets optimized meta, structured data, links, sitemap entry.
* ✅ Your SEO is not standalone – it’s built into the lifecycle of subscription + listing flow.
* 
* 6️⃣ Extra 2025 Enhancements (What I’d Add)
* AI-powered SEO content booster: auto-generate long-tail descriptions for properties (unique per listing, avoids duplicate content penalties).
* Location SEO landing pages: auto-generate /properties/miami/florida pages with aggregated schema + listings.
* Performance SEO: Core Web Vitals (fast LCP, CLS, INP) → image CDN, lazy load, Next.js server-side rendering.
* IndexNow API (Bing + soon Google) → instant indexing of new/updated properties.
* Personalized SERP previews → preview how a property looks in Google before publishing.
* Enterprise logging: every change to metadata stored in DB for auditing.
* 

✅ With this stack, your registration → login → subscription → recovery flow is enterprise-grade and competitive with platforms like Zillow, Airbnb, or Shopify.

# SEO Guide: Properties and Images

This guide defines how property pages and images achieve SEO in the SPA + serverless stack.

## Canonical Property URLs
- Format: `https://www.example.com/p/{slug}-{shortId}` (slug + short ID)
- Redirect `/p/{slug}` -> `/p/{slug}-{shortId}` (301)
- If slug changes: 301 from old slug to new slug (same `{shortId}`)
- API is ID-first: GET `/v1/properties/{id}`; SPA builds slugged path from data

## Page SEO (Property Detail)
- Title: `{price} {currency} • {bedrooms} bd • {city} | {brand}`
- Description: 150–160 chars from key facts (type, beds, baths, sqft, neighborhood)
- Canonical link: `/p/{slug}-{shortId}`
- Open Graph: `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image` (1200x630), `og:type=website`
- Twitter Cards: `summary_large_image`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`
- JSON-LD (recommended): RealEstateListing/Product with `offers`, `address`, `image`, `url`
- Robots: `index,follow` for published; `noindex,nofollow` for drafts/private
- H1: Property title (single H1), semantically structured content with H2 sections

## List/Collection Pages
- Include proper titles and meta descriptions
- Paginated pages: add rel="prev"/"next" (optional), unique titles and meta per page
- Avoid duplicate content; link to details via canonical URLs

## Images SEO
- Filenames: `{slug}-{shortId}-{variant}.webp` (e.g., `ocean-view-penthouse-01ab23-hero.webp`)
- Alt Text: Human-readable; include property type, area, and unique detail (no keyword stuffing)
- Dimensions: Add `width` and `height` attributes where possible
- Lazy Loading: `loading="lazy"` below the fold
- Responsive: Use `srcset` and `sizes`; serve AVIF/WebP with JPEG fallback if needed
- Performance: Compress; prefer CDN (CloudFront) with long cache and versioned URLs
- Structured Data: Include images array in JSON-LD for the property page
- Open Graph: Provide `og:image` 1200x630; also `twitter:image`

## Sitemaps
- `/sitemap.xml` lists key pages + updatedAt; generate from DB
- Image sitemap extension: list primary images for each property
- Regenerate on publish/update; cache results

## Internationalization (optional)
- If localized: add `hreflang` and localized titles/descriptions

## Security & Compliance
- Respect robots (dev/staging `noindex`)
- Avoid exposing private addresses if listing is confidential

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Canonical URL has `slug-shortId`
- [ ] `<title>` and meta description set
- [ ] Canonical link present
- [ ] OG/Twitter tags present
- [ ] JSON-LD valid in Rich Results test
- [ ] Images: descriptive alt, lazy, srcset, optimized
- [ ] Listing is indexed only when published
