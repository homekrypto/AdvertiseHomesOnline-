Project Task Directive — AdvertiseHomes.Online

Objective: Build the full platform from scratch, strictly using real database integration. No dummy data, hardcoded counts, or placeholder metrics. Every feature, dashboard, and API must pull live data from the database and be fully integrated across backend, frontend, and storage layers.

Instructions:

Follow the Phased Task Plan below exactly.

Every dependency must be respected; do not skip earlier phases.

All dashboards, metrics, analytics, and listings must reflect real-time data from the database.

No mock demos; all CRUD operations, subscriptions, and user interactions must persist to the database.

Frontend must be dynamically bound to backend APIs; every UI element querying counts, user info, subscriptions, properties, or leads must come from live DB queries.

Ensure role-based access control for every tier, and strictly gate private dashboards behind login/authentication.

All media, analytics, and automated AI/SEO features must be fully functional, connected to live data, and scalable.
