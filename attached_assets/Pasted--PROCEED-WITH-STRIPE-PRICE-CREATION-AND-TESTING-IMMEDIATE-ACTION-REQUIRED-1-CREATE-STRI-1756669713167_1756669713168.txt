# PROCEED WITH STRIPE PRICE CREATION AND TESTING

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. CREATE STRIPE PRICES IN YOUR PRODUCTION DASHBOARD
**Do this now (takes ~15 minutes):**
- Log in to your **production Stripe dashboard** (not test mode)
- Navigate to: Products → Prices → Create a price
- Create exactly 6 prices with these EXACT specifications:

| Tier | Price ID | Amount | Billing Cycle |
|------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Agent | `price_agent_monthly` | $49.00 USD | Monthly recurring |
| Agent | `price_agent_annual` | $470.40 USD | Yearly recurring |
| Agency | `price_agency_monthly` | $99.00 USD | Monthly recurring |
| Agency | `price_agency_annual` | $950.40 USD | Yearly recurring |
| Expert | `price_expert_monthly` | $299.00 USD | Monthly recurring |
| Expert | `price_expert_annual` | $2,870.40 USD | Yearly recurring |

**Critical Requirements:**
- Use EXACT price IDs as specified (case-sensitive)
- Set currency to USD
- Configure as recurring subscriptions
- Make sure all prices are active

### 2. RUN PRODUCTION TESTS
**Immediately after creating prices:**
- Execute the test script: `./test_subscriptions.sh`
- This will test subscription creation for all tiers
- The script will use real production data (user ID: `1ba87785-5503-41af-bb91-d7830c431449`)

## PROOF OF COMPLETION REQUIRED

### 1. Stripe Price Creation Evidence
**Provide screenshots showing:**
- All 6 prices in your Stripe dashboard
- Correct price IDs and amounts
- USD currency and recurring billing setup

### 2. Test Results
**Share the complete output of:**
- `./test_subscriptions.sh` execution
- Any error messages (if they occur)
- Success confirmations

### 3. Production Verification
**Confirm that:**
- No "price not found" errors appear
- Subscriptions are created in Stripe dashboard
- User subscription status updates in database

## CRITICAL REMINDER
**Every feature must use exclusively live production data. Any component using mock, demo, or hardcoded data will be rejected.**

## IF YOU ENCOUNTER ISSUES
- **Share the exact error messages** from the test script
- **Provide screenshots** of your Stripe price setup
- **Developer will immediately help debug** any problems

## NEXT STEPS
1. Create Stripe prices NOW
2. Run test script IMMEDIATELY after
3. Report results - developer standing by to assist

**The backend is production-ready and waiting for your action. This is the final step to complete your subscription system.**
